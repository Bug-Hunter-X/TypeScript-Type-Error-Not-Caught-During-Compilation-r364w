# TypeScript Type Error Not Caught During Compilation

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a TypeScript type error is not consistently caught during compilation.  Specifically, it involves passing incorrect argument types to a function with explicit type definitions.  The code compiles without error in certain cases, but produces unexpected runtime behavior.  The solution demonstrates proper type guarding to prevent such issues.
